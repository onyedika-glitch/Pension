        personal information to get started.</p>
      <li><h3>Submit Employment History</h3></li>
      <p>Enter relevant employment details, through a simple, guided 
        form. This information helps verify your eligibility for 
        retirement payments.</p>
      <li><h3>Verify and Confirm</h3></li>

        Additional verification documents may be required.</p>

    <h2>PFA Process</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Verify Retiree Information</h3>
        <p>
          As a PFA, your role is to review and verify the employment history submitted by retirees. Cross-check the data provided to ensure it aligns with official records, ensuring accuracy and eligibility.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Capture Biometric Data</h3>
        <p>
          Once the retiree's employment details have been verified, PFAs are responsible for capturing biometric data, such as fingerprints and facial recognition. This added layer of security helps prevent fraud and ensures the authenticity of the retiree's claims.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Submit and Approve</h3>
        <p>
          After validating the information and capturing biometrics, submit the data to the platform for final approval. This step ensures that the retiree can start receiving their payments seamlessly.
        </p>
